# Bootstrap Website with Dark Theme

 My very first attempt to build a website using Bootstrap. Clone for Bootstrap's website with a dark theme.

 ## Lessons learned

 - Bootstrap is cooool.
 - I abandoned the project for a while because I don't really understand how it works. After I decided to resume, I realized it is easier than I thought. Never give up and take some rest if stucks. It helps jumpstart my brain.
 - Responsive website is ezpz with Bootstrap.
 - Learning from copying is the best way of learning! If my brain cannot brain how to do it, I just inspect element on the original Bootstrap website and learn the way the devs did it.
